# Blindify  

**Blindify** is an app designed to give you full control over your phone’s cameras by disabling them at the **root level**. This is especially useful for:  
- Privacy-conscious users who don’t want cameras active 24/7  
- Users who feel uncomfortable having cameras pointed at them all the time  

## How it works  
Blindify disables all phone cameras at the **Virtual File System (/dev) level**, which requires **root access** on your device.  

## Features  
- Simple interface with just **two buttons**:  
  - **Enable Camera**  
  - **Disable Camera**  
- Works system-wide, no background processes.  

## Notes  
- Apps that rely heavily on the camera (e.g., QR code scanners) may crash or not work while the camera is disabled.  
- Functionality will return to normal once you re-enable the camera.
